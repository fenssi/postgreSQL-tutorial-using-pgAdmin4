# Background and Objective
PostgreSQL that is managed via pgAdmin 4, does not have a built-in limit on how long data is stored in your database. But Google BigQuery is cloud-based services which might have data retention policies or limitations based on your billing or usage tier. PostgreSQL gives us control over data retention through its configuration, queries, and management.
In PostgreSQL, we can manage data retention manually, using SQL commands and procedures to archive or delete data as needed. This flexibility allows to keep data for as long as we want, assuming there is sufficient storage resources. 
However, you are responsible for setting up and managing any data retention policies or practices that you need. This tutorial explain how to setting up the database in PostgreSQL via pgAdmin 4.
